# Carousel Test

This repo demonstrates an odd bounce on Android devices when scrolling to the beginning of a horizontal `FlatList`.
The bounce makes scrolling back to the beginning of a carousel-like component frustrating, because it often bounces
away from the beginning in the opposite direction of the swipe.
